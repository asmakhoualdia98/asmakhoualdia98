## 🧠 Personal Statement
My research focuses on **autonomous robot swarms** and how they achieve collective intelligence through simple local rules without direct communication.  
I employ **formal verification, automatic synthesis, and optimization methods** grounded in **satisfiability (SAT/Max-SAT)** and **constraint programming** to guarantee correctness, self-stabilization, and robustness in swarm behaviors.

I also investigate the **logical formulation and self-stabilization properties of distributed algorithms**, such as the *Synchronous Unison* algorithm by Arora et al., using satisfiability-based approaches.
